# Usages

Firstly you need to create an defence html script to upload on the sites..

For your help I have given one script `target.html` so you can use that.

Now you have to run the tool by the commond `python3 wh.py`

Now enter the name of you script _For eg._ `target.html`

Now hit `Enter`

>**And yes If you need to add more websites add it to `target.txt`
 By the way I had given nearly 1500 site..**

Now copy the Website having success stuates and past it to you browser..

***All done...***
